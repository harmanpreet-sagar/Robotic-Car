# Robotic-Car

## Description

This project aims to create a car that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to stop the car when it detects an obstacle in front of it. I used Arduino to code this car and utilized a breadboard to build the circuitry for this car. This car is operated on two sets of batteries and an Arduino processor.

For a working demo of this car, please visit my [website](https://harmanpreetsagar.wixsite.com/website/portfolio#:~:text=MY%20PERSONAL%20PROJECTS-,CAR%20WITH%20A%20SENSOR,-The%20purpose%20of)

## Circuit of the Car
